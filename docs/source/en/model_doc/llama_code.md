# LlamaCode

## Overview

The LlamaCode model was proposed in  TODO
The abstract from the paper is the following:

*TODO*

Checkout all LlamaCode models [here](https://huggingface.co/models?search=llama_code)

Tips:

-  TODO

```bash
python src/transformers/models/llama/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py \
    --input_dir /path/to/downloaded/llama/weights --model_size 7B --output_dir /output/path
```

- After conversion, the model and tokenizer can be loaded via:

```python
from transformers import LlamaForCausalLM, LlamaCodeTokenizer

tokenizer = LlamaCodeTokenizer.from_pretrained("/output/path")
model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained("/output/path")
```

Note that executing the script requires enough CPU RAM to host the whole model in float16 precision (even if the biggest versions
come in several checkpoints they each contain a part of each weight of the model, so we need to load them all in RAM). For the 75B model, it's thus 145GB of RAM needed.

- The LLaMA tokenizer is a BPE model based on [sentencepiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece). One quirk of sentencepiece is that when decoding a sequence, if the first token is the start of the word (e.g. "Banana"), the tokenizer does not prepend the prefix space to the string.

This model was contributed by TODO. The original code of the authors can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama).
